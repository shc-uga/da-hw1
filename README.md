Democratic countries, as indicated by the steeper blue line on the graph, tend to have better access to electricity. Contrastingly, non-democratic countries have less access to electricity.
These democratic states also tend to have less corruption than non-democratic ones. A possible explanation could be that democratic countries oftentimes exhibit checks and balances within the public sector, allowing for better anti-corruption measures. Though, there are still quite a few corrupt democratic countries that share similarities with non-democratic states. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as economic factors, or some could still be transitioning from a non-democratic form of governance. Additionally, CPI and access to electricity may be limited in their data.
